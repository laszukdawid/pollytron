# PollyTron!

## AWS Polly
The component uses AWS Polly serivce as the text-to-speech engine.
To use it, you need to first create an IAM user with Polly permissions.
Keep these AccessKeyId and SecretAccessKey as they're needed, either in `credentials` file or as a direct input in the app config.

## State

It may or may not work. I don't know. I'm giving up on JavaScript ecosystem.
Every few weeks I come back working on it, and it doesn't work.
I fix it to *workable* state so that the next time I can focus only on development but it fails again.
Javascript sucks. Webpack sucks. Electron sucks. I'm out.

## Development

If you find any of the code useful - great.
If you don't find any of the code useful - I'm not surprised.
If you have any questions - use ecosia or duckduckgo.
