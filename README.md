# Mighty PollyTron!

## State
Ok, before you get too excited please know one thing: too much excitment is a recipe for disappointment.

Regarding the state:
* the app starts
* finishes
* can read (short) text from the form
* looks-up credentials (but not region) based on provided profile
* can read (short) text from the clipboard

Yep, it's almost done. Just a few small cosmetic tweaks.

## Progress

I'm planning on adding a few killer features, e.g.:
* Store configuration for later use
* Allow reading text longer than 2 sentences
* Pause media
* Proper instructions on how to build and use
